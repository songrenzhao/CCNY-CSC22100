Programming Assignment #4
(Large-Type Displays for People with Low Vision) The accessibility of computers and the Internet to all people, regardless of disabilities, is becoming more important as these tools play increasing roles in our personal and business lives. According to a recent estimate by the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/en/), 124 million people worldwide have low vision. To learn more about low vision, check out the GUI-based low-vision simulation at www.webaim.org/simulations/lowvision.php.
People with low vision might prefer to choose a font and/or a larger font size when reading electronic documents and web pages. Java has five built-in "logical" fonts that are guaranteed to be available in any Java implementation, including Serif, Sans-serif and Monospaced. Write a GUI application that provides a JTextArea in which the user can type text. Allow the user to select Serif, Sans-serif or Monospaced from a JComboBox. Provide a "Bold" JCheckBox, which, if checked, makes the text bold. Include "Increase Font Size" and "Decrease Font Size" JButtons that allow the user to scale the size of the font up or down, respectively, by one point at a time. Start with a font size of 18 points. For the purposes of this exercise, set the font size on the JComboBox, JButtons and JCheckBox to 20 points so that a person with low vision will be able to read the text on them.
Requirements
Realize your implementation that satisfies the following minimal requirements:
•	2 pt: properly exhibits right logic, i.e., readable and compliable coding
•	2 pt: properly realizes a text area for user input
•	2 pt: properly realizes a font list for user selection
•	2 pt: properly realizes a bold typeset check box and two buttons of font size adjustment
•	2 pt: properly realizes display change in response to user request
The basic interface looks like this (http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~akira/cs221/progs/prog4-sample.png).
